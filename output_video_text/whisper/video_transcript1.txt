 Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see. I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy. Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me. To me. Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, who did mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow. Carry on, carry on, cause if nothing really matters.

We will not let you go. Let me go! Never let you go! Never let me go! Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go! Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me! So you think you can snuff me and spit in my eye? So you think you can love me and leave me to die? Oh baby, can't do this to me baby. Just gotta get out, just gotta get right out of here. Oh yeah! Nothing really matters, anyone can see. Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me. Oh yeah! Only
