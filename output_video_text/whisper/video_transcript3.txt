 If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone. You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles. Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two, Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four, Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home. Away from home, away from home, away from home, away from home. Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home. Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name. Lord I can't go back home this away. If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone. You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles. A hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles, a hundred miles. You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles. You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles. You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.
