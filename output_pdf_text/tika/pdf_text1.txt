Assignment 2 - Subtask 1

3rd March 2024

Introduction

In this assignment, we will gradually build towards a larger project. Subtask 1
needs to be done individually, while the further subtask(s) will need to be done
in groups of 2. We will release details about them later.

For Assignment 2, we will not have any restrictions on programming lan-
guage or framework.

Subtask 1 [Deadline : 14th March 2024]

Subtask 1 involves developing a program to parse text from different multimedia
sources. The goal is to extract text data from videos, audio files, and PDF
documents.

This can be divided into three main parts:

1. Parsing Text from Video: This part requires developing functionality
to extract transcript of video files.

2. Parsing Text from Audio: In this part, the objective is to transcribe
text from audio files.

3. Parsing Text from PDF: The final part involves extracting text content
from PDF documents. This requires parsing the PDF files and extracting
textual data, which may include plain text or structured text elements
such as paragraphs, headings, or lists.

NOTE: Evaluation will be done on the basis of both the quality of generated
text and efficiency of code.
